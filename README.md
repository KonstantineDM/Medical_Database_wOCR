<h2>About</h2>

<p>
GUI program for creating, updating, managing database (DB) with records of 
different educational info in the medical field.

(Database can actually be used for storing any information if you change the
names of columns of the table in DB and buttons of the GUI).
</p>

<h2>Functionality</h2>

<p>
Buttons in the GUI are pretty self-explanatory, I tried to create 'em this way.

MAIN MENU
- Button "Open DB".
  Opens the main GUI for managing the DB.
	- Entry/Text fields for database records;
	- Button "Description (expand)" to expand the Text field, for better
	  readability of big texts (not yet implemented);
	- Button "Add record" to add a new record to the DB (it grabs the info 
	  from all Entry/Text fields);
	- Button "Show records" to display all DB records in a table form;
	- Entry field "Choose topic": enter the ID of the topic you want;
	- Button "Edit record": edit record, chosen in the "Choose topic" field
	  (opens a separate GUI for editiong);
	  - Entry/Text fields for database records;
	  - Button "Save changes": commit changes made to the record;
	  - Button "Clear all fields": clear all Entry/Text fields;	
	- Button "Delete record": delete record, chosen in the "Choose topic" field.
